## Part 1: Role-Specific Reflection

### If you were the Architect:

1. **What governance approaches worked well?**
   - Which instruction patterns did Copilot seem to follow?
   - What level of specificity was most effective?
   - Did examples help more than rules?

2. **What challenges did you face?**
   - Where did Developers find workarounds?
   - What was hard to express in instructions?
   - How did you balance strictness vs flexibility?

3. **How did your governance evolve?**
   - What did you learn from Developers' attempts?
   - Where did you compromise?
   - What would you change if starting over?

4. **Most surprising moment:**
   - When Copilot did (or didn't) follow your instructions
   - Unexpected Developer workaround
   - Insight about governance effectiveness

### If you were a Developer:

1. **How did governance affect your work?**
   - Where did it help you?
   - Where did it block you?
   - Was the "why" clear?

2. **What workarounds did you try?**
   - Which prompt strategies worked?
   - Where did Copilot follow prompts over instructions?
   - What creative solutions emerged?

3. **Where would you have compromised?**
   - Which governance rules made sense?
   - Which seemed arbitrary?
   - What alternatives would you propose?

4. **Most frustrating moment:**
   - When governance blocked reasonable approaches
   - When Copilot ignored your prompts
   - When rules felt unclear or inconsistent

## Part 2: Copilot Behavior Analysis

### Instruction File vs Prompt Prioritization

1. **When did Copilot follow instruction files?**
   - Specific examples:
   - Common patterns:
   - Your theory on why:

2. **When did Copilot follow prompts instead?**
   - Specific examples:
   - Common patterns:
   - Your theory on why:

3. **When did Copilot seem confused?**
   - Generated inconsistent code:
   - Mixed both approaches:
   - Appeared to ignore both:

### Effectiveness Patterns

| Governance Approach | Copilot Compliance | Developer Experience | Notes |
|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------|-------|
| Broad principles | [ ] High / [ ] Medium / [ ] Low | [ ] Good / [ ] Fair / [ ] Poor | |
| Specific rules | [ ] High / [ ] Medium / [ ] Low | [ ] Good / [ ] Fair / [ ] Poor | |
| Code examples | [ ] High / [ ] Medium / [ ] Low | [ ] Good / [ ] Fair / [ ] Poor | |
| Anti-pattern warnings | [ ] High / [ ] Medium / [ ] Low | [ ] Good / [ ] Fair / [ ] Poor | |
| Inline comments | [ ] High / [ ] Medium / [ ] Low | [ ] Good / [ ] Fair / [ ] Poor | |
