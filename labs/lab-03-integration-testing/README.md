# Lab 03: Integration Testing and Quality Gates

This lab demonstrates how Copilot agent mode can help enforce integration testing and quality gates.

## Scenario
You are given a multi-module codebase with missing or incomplete integration tests. The instruction file documents testing standards and quality gate requirements.

## Assignment
1. Review `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for testing and quality gate standards.
2. Use Copilot agent mode to:
   - Identify missing integration tests
   - Write or improve integration tests
   - Ensure code passes all quality gates (lint, coverage, CI)
3. Update the instruction file with new testing patterns as needed.
4. Reflect: How did Copilot assist with test generation and quality enforcement?

## Files
- `src/` — Example code with integration points
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` — Testing and quality gate instructions

Proceed to the `src` folder and `.github` for hands-on tasks.
