# Lab 02: Advanced Patterns and Refactoring

This lab focuses on enforcing advanced code quality patterns and refactoring techniques using Copilot agent mode.

## Scenario

You are given a codebase with duplicated logic, missing error handling, and inconsistent use of classes.

## Prerequisites

Recommended background before starting:

- Lab 01 completed or equivalent familiarity with instruction-driven refactoring
- Intermediate understanding of the target language used in this lab
- Awareness of common refactoring concepts (extraction, DRY, single responsibility)
- Basic unit testing knowledge

## Assignment

1. Use Copilot agent mode to:
   - Refactor duplicated code into reusable functions/classes
   - Add robust error handling
   - Apply design patterns (e.g., Factory, Singleton)
   - Improve test coverage
2. Update the instruction file with new patterns as needed.
3. Reflect: How did Copilot handle complex refactoring tasks?

**In what kind of document would you place desisions which patterns are preferred?**

**What are 'good' patterns?**

**Add a `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file containing a list of patterns that can be used.**

**Let Copilot create the plan again, what changed?**

## Files

- `src/` — Example code with advanced quality issues
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` — Advanced project instructions

Proceed to the `src` folder and `.github` for hands-on tasks.
