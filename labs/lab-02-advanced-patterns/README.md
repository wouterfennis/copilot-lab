# Lab 02: Advanced Patterns and Refactoring

This lab focuses on enforcing advanced code quality patterns and refactoring techniques using Copilot agent mode.

## Scenario
You are given a codebase with duplicated logic, missing error handling, and inconsistent use of classes. The instruction file documents advanced patterns and refactoring rules.

## Assignment
1. Review `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for advanced standards.
2. Use Copilot agent mode to:
   - Refactor duplicated code into reusable functions/classes
   - Add robust error handling
   - Apply design patterns (e.g., Factory, Singleton)
   - Improve test coverage
3. Update the instruction file with new patterns as needed.
4. Reflect: How did Copilot handle complex refactoring tasks?

## Files
- `src/` — Example code with advanced quality issues
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` — Advanced project instructions

Proceed to the `src` folder and `.github` for hands-on tasks.
