# Lab 01: Basic Copilot Instructions

This lab demonstrates how a simple instruction file can guide Copilot to improve code quality.

## Scenario

You are given a small codebase with inconsistent formatting and missing documentation. The project uses a custom instruction file to enforce standards.

## Assignment

1. Review the provided `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.
2. Use Copilot agent mode to:
   - Refactor code to match the documented standards
   - Add missing docstrings/comments
   - Fix formatting issues
3. Update the instruction file to address any gaps you discover.
4. Reflect: How did the instructions affect Copilot's suggestions?

## Files

- `src/` — Example code with quality issues
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` — Project instructions for Copilot

Proceed to the `src` folder and `.github` for hands-on tasks.
