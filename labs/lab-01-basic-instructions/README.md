# Lab 01: Basic Copilot Instructions

This lab demonstrates how a simple instruction file can guide Copilot to improve code quality.

## Scenario

You are given a small codebase with inconsistent formatting and missing documentation.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this lab you should be comfortable with:

- Basic Git workflow (clone, commit, diff)
- Reading simple Python code
- Markdown editing basics
- Using Copilot Chat / agent mode in your IDE

If any of these are unfamiliar, review them briefly before proceeding.

## Assignment

1. Review the provided .
2. Use Copilot agent mode to:
   - Refactor code to match the documented standards
   - Add missing docstrings/comments
   - Fix formatting issues
3. Consider adding a instruction file `.github/copilot-instructions.md` to address any gaps you discover.
4. Reflect: How did the instructions affect Copilot's suggestions?

**Should some parts of this plan be stored in a instruction file for future use?**
**Ask Copilot to demonstrate how such file would look like.**

**Can you retry the exercise with the instruction file already in place? Did the results get better?**

## Files

- `src/` — Example code with quality issues
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` — Project instructions for Copilot

Proceed to the `src` folder and `.github` for hands-on tasks.
