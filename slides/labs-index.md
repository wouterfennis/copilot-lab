### How to Use

1. Pick a lab in order or jump to one you need.  
2. Read its README.  
3. Start with a planning prompt (do not code yet).  
4. Apply functional style rules from ../.github/copilot-instructions.md.  
5. Record decisions if the lab includes a DECISIONS or REFLECTION file.

### Core Reminder

Always: plan → confirm → implement → review diff → refine.
