# Building Complex Cloud-Based Systems with .NET

Elevate your software engineering skills by designing, building, and operating scalable cloud systems with C#, .NET, and modern DevOps practices.

---

## Why This Minor Matters

- Real-world complexity: resilience, scaling, modularity
- Modern delivery: build → test → deploy (continuous delivery mindset)
- Architectural thinking: event-driven & microservices patterns
- Professional readiness: teamwork, process, tooling, quality
- Direct coaching from experienced industry practitioners

---

## Learning Objectives (Leerdoelen)

After completion you can:
 
1. Design an event-driven microservice architecture adapted to a complex domain
2. Apply architectural principles under defined constraints
3. Set up a complete CI/CD pipeline (e.g., Azure DevOps)
4. Formulate & prioritize requirements amid uncertainty
5. Achieve consistent, sustainable code quality with automation

## Technologies & Tools

- C#, .NET Core / ASP.NET Core
- Azure DevOps (boards, repos, pipelines)
- Docker & Kubernetes
- Messaging / brokers (e.g., RabbitMQ)
- Test stacks (xUnit, MoQ) & specification tooling (Gherkin/Reqnroll)
- Observability & logging fundamentals
